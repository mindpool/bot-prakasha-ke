Known Issues
------------

* when a user nick changes, the change is logged on all channels, even if that
  user is not logged into one of the channels

* when ``make generate-config`` is called, if the file already exists, it is
  not backed up -- simply removed


New Features
------------

* add in-line image (logo) to README

* add notes in README about launchpad project URL, blueprint usage, code repos,
  where to submit bugs, patches, etc.

* fix usage notes

* fix initial screen re-draw after login with terminal.app on Mac OS X

* add support for scheduling messages

* add support for setting/updating the bot's schedule

* add support for passing JSON as a command, e.g.:
  $ ssh -p 6622 localhost "<json * data>"

* add tab-completion to the shell

* when the logger first signs on, log the users who are currently on channel

* add support for an additional authorized_keys file, so that access to the
  bot's shell may be possible without granting access to the machine/account it
  is hosted on

* add an RSS/Atom listener that posts updates to IRC when new commits come in,
  e.g.: https://github.com/dreamhost/bot-prakasha-ke/commits/master.atom
