Known Issues
------------

* when a user nick changes, the change is logged on all channels, even if that
  user is not logged into one of the channels

* when ``make generate-config`` is called, if the file already exists, it is
  not backed up -- simply removed

* the publisher factory can no longer create a client that connects... it just
  continuously retries a connection


New Features
------------

* add in-line image (logo) to README

* add notes in README about launchpad project URL, blueprint usage, code repos,
  where to submit bugs, patches, etc.

* fix usage notes

* fix initial screen re-draw after login with terminal.app on Mac OS X

* add support for scheduling messages

* add support for setting/updating the bot's schedule

* add support for passing JSON as a command, e.g.:
  $ ssh -p 6622 localhost "<json * data>"

* add tab-completion

* add an API call to list (and log) all the members of a channel
